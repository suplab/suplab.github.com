## TECHIE.GEEK.PHOTOGRAPHER.TREKKER

  I'm an oddball really!! I whole heartedly embrace technology, and yet like to spend lonely nights on mountain tops, away from civilisation. :P

Photography is kind of a passion for me, a way for me to unwind. It all started with my grandfather's minolta film SLR, and my life has never been the same.

I'm not really an adventure junkie, but I do like to go on treks and hikes, primarily because each trek is a journey, inwhich I discover myself.

Finally I believe in a very in a very simple philosophy, which I imbibe regularly---

<blockquote>"The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows. It's a very mean and nasty place and I don't care how tough you are it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain't about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done!" - Rocky Balboa</blockquote>
