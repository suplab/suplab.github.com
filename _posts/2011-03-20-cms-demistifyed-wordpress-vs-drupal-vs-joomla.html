title: CMS Demistifyed - Wordpress vs Drupal vs Joomla
---
<blockquote>A content management system (CMS) is the collection  of tools used to  manage, store, retrieve data for an individual or  enterprise.</blockquote>
<br><br>
It often becomes a necessity when we have to choose between a CMS for  our needs. Although there are a number of CMS available out there, we  will primarily focus our discussion here to <strong>Wordpress</strong>, <strong>Joomla</strong> and <strong>Drupal</strong>. All three of these are open-CMS type, each having  its own advantages and disadvantages.
<br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_content_management_systems" >NOTE: You may browse through a list of CMS here</a>
<br><br>
The best way to understand the relative advantages and disadvantages  of the three CMS is by chalking out the differences as follows:
<br><br>
<table style="border:2px dotted #AAAAAA">
	<tr style="border:2px dotted #AAAAAA">
		<td>   </td>
		<td>WordPress</td>
		<td>Joomla</td>
		<td>Drupal</td>
	</tr>
	<tr style="border:2px dotted #AAAAAA">
		<td>Reliability</td>
		<td>WordPress has always lived up to its name  no matter what type of website it’s running. But when it comes to  reliability with WordPress, I would have to say it would be the highest  out of all three of these systems. I’ve been using WordPress for quite  some time now, and I have to say, I’ve really gotten to know the  interface and how the community works with it. Because the community for  WordPress is quite large, bugs, updates, or even suggestions are  handled at the highest priority because it is in fact one of the largest  open source blogging (even though it can be used for much more than  just blogging) systems out there.</td>
		<td>I have to say Joomla is one of the least  reliable systems out there. It can be very sluggish at times and it was  also quite glitchy at certain times also. To get Joomla to do some  things what the other two systems can do requires some third party  plugins, which in the end of it, adds more room for error because of  being third party and some of them being in very early stages of  development, which many plugins are.</td>
		<td>Drupal has to be one of my favorite systems  out there. It’s great for blogging, running an e-commerce website, or  even using it for your product page of your latest application. Drupal’s  reliability is very high compared to Joomla (atleast in my opinion),  but I’m not sure if I would say it’s any better or worse than WordPress.  Drupal is a very stable system and I’ve never had any major problems  with it before.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr style="border:2px dotted #AAAAAA">
		<td>Security</td>
		<td>WordPress has had its security issues  before, but as of right now, the security issues are very tight in  WordPress and if there is any security issues, it’s typically caused by  WordPress’s third party plugins.</td>
		<td>Okay, I’m not the person to ask about security  issues in Joomla, but, I have to say, Joomla is the worst CMS program  I’ve ever used when it comes to security.</td>
		<td>For the most part, Drupal is very secure.  There were some major security issues in the past but up till recently, I  cannot say there’s really anything in regards to security issues.  Drupal powers some pretty hefty sites and it’s why some people prefer it  as the CMS as choice for some very major websites.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr style="border:2px dotted #AAAAAA">
		<td>Extendability</td>
		<td>Without a doubt I would have to say  WordPress has the most extendability out of any CMS system. WordPress  has a vast amount of themes ranging from free to paid, many plugins to  extend WordPress to do anything you want, and also the basic system of  managing plugins overall is very easy to use (especially in WordPress  3.0). Whether you want to add, delete, or even modify an existing  plugin, it’s very easy to do in WordPress. Moreover creating themes for  Wordpress is probably the easiest among the three.</td>
		<td>For any Joomla user, it comes with a good  amount of plugins, or which are called extensions in Joomla, but some  plugins are a bit lazily made or they just don’t work correctly all the  time. In other words, there are quite a few plugins that you want to  avoid in Joomla. Also, compared to the out-of-the-box extendability,  Joomla doesn’t have as near the amount of features than other CMS  systems. It doesn’t even have a native comment system. Granted, Joomla  isn’t entirely meant for a blog, but a good portion of users use it for  that reason. For theming support, Joomla comes with a good amount of  themes and some websites even dedicated for Joomla themes.</td>
		<td>I have to say Drupal’s plugins are fairly nice  and it’s very easy to write one on your own, but I see some plugins, or  what Drupal calls modules, that are a bit neglected. Finding themes for  Drupal can be a bit harder because there’s not as much as WordPress,  but you can typically find a theme that’ll fit your needs/wants. And as a  developer, I finding theming Drupal to be rather easy.</td>
	</tr>

So, the final question is which is better. The answer is simple  really, each has a different area where each excels.  I my opinion, if  you want a blog , go for Wordpress. If your need is an e-commerce site,  choose Drupal or Joomla. If your requirement is a static site, then  choose either of these (though personally I would go for Wordpress).

Wordpress is probably the most used and liked of all the CMS. Drupal  represents an 'advanced' CMS for users who really know the stuff. And  Joomla, requires a little bit more to do.
