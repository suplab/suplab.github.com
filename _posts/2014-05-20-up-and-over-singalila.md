This post has been long due since last year.
This post is essentially a travelog of the Singalila Trek which I took last year in November with a bunch of like-minded fools :P.

# The Trip:
The entire trip was from **Nov 7,2013 - Nov 16,2013**. All of us except Anik are currently based in Kolkata. So we decided to travel together, and catch up with Anik at Siliguri. So on the evening of 7th, I, Santanu, Anubhab, Saunak and Indra, boarded the Kanchankanya Express from Sealdah Railway Station. Onlookers gave weird glances, as we boarded the train with our rucksacks, sleeping mattresses, tents and sleeping bags.

The journey itself was quite eventful really! We shared the coupe with a south indian family, who were pretty sure that, we were occupying their seats. :P
That got sorted quickly, and the train started chugging towards New Jalpaiguri (NJP).
Our journey had finally started. The mountains were calling!!!

### Day 1 - NJP to Hilley
We reached NJP station the following morning. The train was late by half an hour. It was time to meet the final member of the team, Anik. Anik currently a resident in Pune, had reached Siliguri the previous day. 


### Day 2 - Hilley to Deoningaly Dhap

### Day 3 - Deoningaly Dahp to Tulodhap

### Day 4 - Tulodhap to Kalijhar

### Day 5 - Kalijhar to Singalila Pass to Phalut

### Day 6 - Phalut to Gorkhey

### Day 7 - Stay at Gorkhey

### Day 8 - Gorkhey to NJP
