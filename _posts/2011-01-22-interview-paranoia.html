title: Interview Paranoia
---
Got my offer letter from <a href="http://www.tcs.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Tata Consultancy Services</strong></a> a couple of days ago. Hopefully will be joining as an <strong>Assistant Systems Engineer</strong>.
 Thought I would describe the interview which took place on 13th January.
 Now TCS usually has two rounds: <strong>Aptitude Test</strong> and <strong>Personal Interview (Technical and HR)</strong>.
 Being in the top 5 in our stream, I did not have to sit for the aptitude test and was given a chance to appear for the Personal Interview directly.
 The cut-off for the aptitude in our college was 33 out of 35 (which is unexpectedly high).

 I went for the interview and was greeted by a young recruiter from TCS, and then the following took place:
 <br>
 <strong>Interviewer</strong>: So you are Suplab Debnath?
  <br>
 <strong>Me</strong> <i>(with a big smile)</i>: Yes Sir
  <br>
 <strong>Interviewer</strong> <i>(glancing through my CV)</i>: So where is Durganagar (...its my address)?
  <br>
 <strong>Me</strong>: explained in detail
  <br>
 <strong>Interviewer</strong> <i>(with a smile)</i>: You seem very calm. Do you ever get excited?
  <br>
 <strong>Me</strong>: Yes sir, I am calm and I do get excited under certain situations.
  <br>
 <strong>Interviewer</strong>: Do you like sports?
  <br>
 <strong>Me</strong>: Not really sir, I am more of a foodie and I have a knack for cooking.
  <br>
 <strong>Interviewer</strong>: So you like pizzas, burgers?
  <br>
 <strong>Me</strong> <i>(with a smile)</i>: No sir,  i love home cooked meals more....
  <br>
 <strong>Interviewer</strong> <i>(also smiling)</i>: Like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luchi" target="_blank">luchi</a>, <a href="http://www.ifood.tv/recipe/aloor-dum-bengali-style-dum-aloo" target="_blank">aloor-dum</a>, ....
  <br>
 <strong>Me</strong>: Yes sir.
  <br>
 <strong>Interviewer</strong>: Are you feeling confident?
  <br>
 <strong>Me</strong>: Yes Sir.
  <br>
 <strong>Interviewer</strong>: Can you tell me the difference between Oracle and MySQL?
  <br>
 <strong>Me</strong>: <i>Tried to point out a few differences...but he didn't seem convinced </i>
  <br>
 <strong>Interviewer</strong>: What is an ER- Diagram?
  <br>
 <strong>Me</strong>: <i>Explained it with confidence.</i>
  <br>
 <strong>Interviewer</strong>: Can you draw the ER diagram for a Library Management System.
  <br>
 <strong>Me</strong>: <i>Did so...</i>
  <br>
 <strong>Interviewer</strong>: <i>(Pointed out a few details)</i> what will happen if i remove this (and that)?
  <br>
 <strong>Me</strong>: <i>Tried to explain (atleast as much as I knew)</i>
  <br>
 <strong>Interviewer</strong>: Implement 5NF in a table?
  <br>
 <strong>Me</strong>: <i>Defined 5NF, because honestly I didn't know how to do it</i>
  <br>
 <strong>Interviewer</strong> <i>(not impressed)</i>: What is DKNF?
  <br>
 <strong>Me</strong>: <i>Explained</i>
  <br>
 <strong>Interviewer</strong>: You are the onlyson of your parents?
  <br>
 <strong>Me</strong>: Yes Sir
  <br>
 <strong>Interviewer</strong>: What if you are not selected?
  <br>
 <strong>Me</strong> <i>(seriously)</i>: Sir I have the right aptitude for this job, and have the technical know-how. I am confident you will select me.
 <br>
 Next He starts asking me a few weird questions from C and Datastructure, most of which I fail to answer. :(
 <br>
 <strong>Interviewer</strong> <i>(with a smile)</i>: Still Confident?
  <br>
 <strong>Me</strong>: Yes Sir
  <br>
 <strong>Interviewer</strong>: What is an AVL tree?
  <br>
 <strong>Me</strong>: <i>(explained) </i>
  <br>
 <strong>Interviewer</strong> <i>(draws a tree on a sheet of paper)</i>: Is this an AVL tree?
  <br>
 <strong>Me</strong>: No sir, we have to balance it to form an AVL tree
  <br>
 <strong>Interviewer</strong>: Then balance it
  <br>
 <strong>Me</strong>: <i>(tried to but not perfect :P)</i>
 <br>
 Next He asked me a few questions from Java, and I nailed it. :D
 <br>
 <strong>Interviewer</strong>: Do you have any questions?
  <br>
 <strong>Me</strong>: Sir since I have done my summer training in PHP, is there any scope of my utilising it in TCS?
  <br>
 <strong>Interviewer</strong>: We do have a few areas where we do implement it, but be ready to learn new things.
  <br>
 <strong>Me</strong>: <i>(assured him that I am always willing to try out new technologies)</i>
  <br>
 <strong>Interviewer</strong>: Any other questions?
  <br>
 <strong>Me</strong>: No sir
  <br>
 <strong>Interviewer</strong>: Alright that will be all you may leave
 <br>
 I got up shook his hand and left :)
 <br>
 That was my first interview experience!!!!
