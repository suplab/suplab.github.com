title: Side by Side Div?
---
Alright my friend have been asking me this question for quite sometime now :


<blockquote>How do you put two divs side by side?</blockquote>
It is really simple and there are different ways to do it, but personally I prefer to use a certain property of CSS called <strong>float</strong>. The float property has two values, namely <em>left</em> and <em>right</em>.
<br />
And here is how it is achieved:
<br />
<h2>The Code</h2>
In your css create 2 divs and call them, say, <strong>lefty</strong> and <strong>righty</strong>
{% highlight css lineos %}
#lefty{
        float:left;
        background:#ff0000;
        color:#ffffff;
        width:130px;
}
#righty{
        float:right;
        background:#0000ff;
        color:#ffffff;
        width:130px;
}
{% endhighlight %}
In your HTML file just call the two divs and use them, as you wish.
<h2>And hopefully your result will be</h2>
<code><div style="float:left;background:#ff0000;color:#ffffff;width:130px;">Div 1</div>
<div style="float:right;background:#0000ff;color:#ffffff;width:130px;">Div 2</div></code>
<br><br><br><br><br>
