For quite sometime now, I wanted to provide a single sign-in facility for my website so that it helps me connect my site to the social web. While I was looking for various alternatives I found this powerful tool -<strong>Janrain Engage (formerly RPX)</strong>.
<h2>What is Janrain Engage</h2>
Janrain Engage helps connect your site to the social web through a robust set of APIs and social widget interfaces. Janrain Engage <strong>allows your visitors to sign-in to your site with their existing accounts</strong> on Facebook, Google, Twitter, Yahoo!, LinkedIn, Windows Live, MySpace, AOL or other networks and then <strong>publish their comments, purchases, reviews or other activities from your site to multiple social networks</strong>.

Ultimately, a Janrain Engage solution accelerates your user registration and sign-in process by quickly and easily converting anonymous site visitors into active registered users. In addition, Janrain Engage enables you to import a rich set of profile data  from your users' preferred networks allowing you to gain both deeper insight into your users behavior and keep their profiles up to date.
<h2>Feature</h2>

<li>&bull; Authentication via Facebook, Google, Twitter, Yahoo!, LinkedIn, Windows Live and up to 10 additional social platforms.</li>
<li>&bull; Ability to gather rich online user profile data and address books.</li>
