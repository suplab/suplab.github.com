title: Facebook Versus Google+ [Infographic]
---
With Google launching its new social networking project <a href="http://plus.google.com" target="_blank">google+</a>, it is only logical that a comparison with facebook follows. Facebook recently launched the new video chat feature which is powered by Microsoft Skype.
Everyone is comparing the features of these 2 giants from then. Guys at <a href="http://www.technobombs.com/infographic-facebook-vs-google/" target="_blank">Techno Bombs</a> have made an awesome infographic to compare these two. I am here to share it with you...
