<p><a href="http://blog.hunch.com/?p=45344">Profile of a Self-Described Mac Person vs. PC Person</a> is a fun infographic looking at personality and preference differences. &nbsp;Based on 388,315 survey respondents from <a href="http://hunch.com/">Hunch.com</a>, it illustrates topics like who throws parties, math aptitude, taste in art, cocktail drinks of choice and would they ride a Vespa or a Harley.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Our latest data project was to analyze how self-described Mac and PC people are different. The infographic below, designed by the talented folks at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.columnfivemedia.com/" target="_blank">Column Five Media</a>, breaks it down.</em></p>
<p><em>Back in ye olden days of Hunch &mdash; November 2009 &mdash; we explored the differences in personality, aesthetic tastes, and media preferences between&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.hunch.com/?p=10124">Mac and PC users</a>. Since then, the Hunch user base and question pool have grown many times over. The 2009 report started with more than 76,000 responses to its base &ldquo;Mac or PC?&rdquo; question. The same question now has nearly 400,000 responses. This is all in the context of the more than 80 million &ldquo;Teach Hunch About You&rdquo; questions which have been answered on Hunch to date.</em></p>
