title: POST JSON data in PHP
---
I was working with PHP the other day and had to send JSON data, and got stuck at a problem: How to send a POST request from PHP with correct-formatted JSON data?
Now you can't send post fields, because you want to send JSON. So the solution?

Well the solution is like this:
<strong>1. We create the correct JSON data
2. Set that as the body of the POST request
3. Set the headers correctly so that the server understands what we sent</strong>

Here's how we do it:
[php]
$data = array(&quot;first_name&quot; =&gt; &quot;Suplab&quot;, &quot;last_name&quot; =&gt; &quot;Debnath&quot;);                                                                    
$data_string = json_encode($data);                                                                                   
 
$ch = curl_init('http://api.local/rest/users');                                                                      
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST, &quot;POST&quot;);                                                                     
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $data_string);                                                                  
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);                                                                      
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, array(                                                                          
    'Content-Type: application/json',                                                                                
    'Content-Length: ' . strlen($data_string))                                                                       
);                                                                                                                   
 
$result = curl_exec($ch);
[/php]

To understand <code>curl_setopt()</code> better you can visit <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.curl-setopt.php" target="_blank">here</a>.
What we are trying to do is make a POST request, but the body of the request is set to the json-encoded data, and the setting the proper headers to describe the request body. The <code>CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER</code> is used so that the response from the server gets thrown into <code>$result</code> rather than get echoed.
