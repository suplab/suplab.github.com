title: Nothing Can Be As Crazy... - A Review
comments: true
---
Off the things which I do regularly in my life, visiting the book fair is one of them. This year I picked up a copy of "Nothing Can Be As Crazy" by Ajay Mohan Jain, hoping it would be a wonderful read. And honestly after finishing the book last night, I realized it has become one of my favorites.
The author, Ajay Mohan Jain is an alumunus of IIT Kanpur and trained at IIM Ahmedabad, who has worked for a leading commercial bank for many years.
<blockquote><strong><em>Nothing can be as Crazy...</em></strong> is the story of a typical service-class Indian, Suresh, who works in a bank. He is naive and conservative, and finds himself out of sync at every stage of life. Being a second-generation city migrant, he has not yet acquired the urban garb completely, and still finds certain things beyond his perception.</blockquote>
The novel is set mainly in the cities of Hyderabad and Calcutta(now Kolkata) and Uttar Pradesh. The main protagonist of the novel is Suresh, an ex-IIT"ian, who is an introvert by nature. Although the "never-say-die" attitude of suresh is commendable.
Unlike other novels, this one is more like a collection of past experiences, instead of a long piece of story. The book manages to capture almost all faecets of life, from the first job experiences, the typical bull-sessions with friends, the first experiences of boozing and women, to the seriousness of family life.
The reader finds himself/herself maturing with each page he/she turns. Towards the beginning of the book we see life with curiousity, having fun with friends, trying out new things and enjoying the state of being employed. But with each passing chapter we find that life is a weird mesh of events which teaches us one lesson after another, until finally we learn to accept life and its crazy ways.
The author also provides a detailed description about the inner sanctums of work-life and the way in which it is filled with corruption and fake attitutudes of people.
In short it is a wonderful book to read, teaching us the crazy ways of life and helping us remember our past crazy days... :)
