title: I'm Sorry...
---
<strong>Pencil:</strong> I'm sorry.
<br>
<strong>Eraser:</strong> For what? You didn't do anything wrong.
<br>
<strong>Pencil:</strong> I'm sorry, you get hurt because of me. Whenever I made a mistake, you're always there to erase it. But as you make my mistakes vanish, you lose a part of yourself and get smaller and smaller each time.
<br>
<strong>Eraser:</strong> That's true, but I don't really mind. You see, I was made to do this, I was made to help you whenever you do something wrong, even though one day I know I'll be gone. I'm actually happy with my job. So please, stop worrying I hate seeing you sad.
