title: The Wait
---
Well this post is kind of a personal note rather than an informative piece of text. If you know mw well, you probably know that I got my offer letter from <strong><a href="http://tcs.com" target="_blank">Tata Consultancy Services</a></strong> in January of this year, as I had mentioned in a previous post. But that was rather easy compared to the last eight months waiting patiently for the "YET TO BE BATCHED" to change into a valid date and place. The wait became more frustrating perhaps because close friends were leaving for their companies and some had already started work.

And then there are the nosy neighbours and weird relatives, who never fail to point out, <i>"Kire ekhono aseni?"</i> or <i>"kobe jachchis training'e?"</i> and a number of other such questions. The pressure builds to a point, when you start to doubt your memory of actually clearing the interview and accepting the offer letter.

The last few months I tried reading, giving tutions, watching some stupid movies which I didn't even like and "playing dead" on my bed. But quite frankly nothing helped. The news of other colleges receiving their joining letters didn't help much either.

So anyways long story(of frustrating wait) short received my joining letter on the 14th September night. As written the training will be in Kolkata, but will commence from 28th march 2012 :(.
I'm part relieved because, now atleast there is something to look forward to, but the again another wait for 6 months...
Life's such a pain in the ass, I tell you.

P.S.: What a waste of cyberspace right? :P
