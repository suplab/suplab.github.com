Thank you very much <strong>Mr. Christopher Nolan</strong>, for that wonderful movie of yours. Yeah, I'm referring to "<strong>Inception</strong>" (you know, the one about dream theft :P ). Well anyways, this is not a review about the movie, nor am I planning to write one.
This is more like a story (atleast that's what I would like to call it), with its place and characters all real, atleast as real as it can be.
Anyways thought I would write about it....
 <br> <br>
The events of this story started last night at 8pm, when I decided to watch "Inception" again, frankly because I could never really figure out the last part of the movie.
Following the movie, had a wonderful dinner(courtesy of my mother) and went to bed. Now, I'm lying on the bed, listening to the tick-tocks of that wretched clock of mine, and I don't know when I slip into a reverie of dreams.
 <br> <br>
Now this is where things start to get weird.....
 <br> <br>
<em>I am sitting with my laptop, doing something(which I don't distinctly remember)...... I check my clock.... its 3pm....
My dad comes into my room....</em> <br>
<strong>DAD:</strong> Has the guy from the AC service centre come yet? <br>
<strong>ME:</strong> Is he supposed to? Well not yet, he hasn't..... <br>
<em>My dad leaves..... feeling tired.... I decide to take a power-nap :P</em> <br>
 <br>
<em>I wake up and find myself at a corridor in our school, Frank Anthony Public School.... weird... <br>
but no one is around.... weirder...... I find myself taking the stairs to the roof. <br>
I'm on the roof, and wow what a beautiful weather... clear sky with a bright sun... <br>
Suddenly a cloaked figure appears infront of me.... he turns around.... hey I know this guy, its my friend <a href="http://bibhas.in" target="_blank">LazyBlogger</a></em> <br>
<strong>HIM:</strong> Dude, I'm not who you think I am. <br>
<em>Duh!!!... what?.. wait a minute I know this guy for the past 4 years and why does he sound like Marlon Brando...?????....</em> <br>
<strong>HIM (with a weird grin on his face):</strong> I am a CIA agent, and you have something that belongs to me... <br>
<em>CIA...nah... he a tech-wiz no doubt, but CIA... and what do I have that belongs to him???</em> <br>
<strong>ME:</strong> I do? <br>
<strong>HIM (taking out a gun from under that long dark cloak):</strong> You don't remember? <br>
<strong>ME:</strong> Is that a real gun? <em>(I can be a real ass sometimes even in my dreams :P)</em> <br>
<strong>HIM:</strong> Give me my CD or you're history. <br>
<strong>ME:</strong> What CD? <br>
 <br> <br>
<em>...and thats when it clicked...</em><strong></strong> <br>
 <br> <br>
<strong>ME:</strong> You mean the Ubuntu 10.10 CD? But I don't have it here, will give it to you tomorrow in college.... <br> 
<strong>HIM:</strong> Check the left pocket of your jacket... <br>
<em>....what jacket? I wasn't wearig any jacket.... <br>
well it so happened I was wearing one... and out of the left pocket came the Ubuntu 10.10 CD <br>
phew!!!!... I'm saved... I hand it over to him...</em> <br>
<strong>HIM:</strong> Well goodbye then... <br>
<em>..his gun still pointing at me.....</em> <br>
<strong>ME:</strong> Why? <br>
<strong>HIM:</strong> Because now you know I'm CIA. <br>
<strong>ME:</strong> Wait a minute.... I won't tell anyone... please... <br> 
<strong>HIM:</strong> That's what they all say..... <br>
<em><strong>BANG!!!!... BANG!!!!!</strong></em> <br>
 <br> <br>
<em>I sit up with a jolt..... on my bed... my laptop still open on my working table..... <br>
The bell rings...I hear someone opening the door...I hear my dad calling out to me</em> <br>
<strong>DAD: </strong>The AC service man has come, could you see to it that he does the job properly, I'm going out... <br>
<strong>ME:</strong> Okay <br>
<em>....phew it was dream......</em> <br>
 <br> <br>
<em>I get up....and suddenly a loud monotonous ringing sound.....</em> <br>
 <br> <br>
I reach out and stop the alarm of my table clock right beside my bed... I'm lying on my bed.... Its 6:30 in the morning today
 <br> <br>
And I realized I had had a dream inside a dream.... neat :D <br>
.... a first for me... well atleast the first I remember atleast..
 <br> <br>
Another weird day(or night) In my Life. :P
