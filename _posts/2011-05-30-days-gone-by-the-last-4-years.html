It took some time to gather all the feelings and memories , but in the end could not put them in letters, because words are not just enough to describe the emotions . This post is a tribute to my four  years at <a href="http://nit.ac.in" target="_blank"><strong>Narula Institute of Technology</strong></a>; to friends and to the innumerable people I have met over the years, who have inspired me, taught me and made me what I am today. 
26th May , 2011 was the day when I bid adieu to my college. Now that I look back the last two decades of student life has been really a wonderful experience. Like others I have had my ups and downs, happiness and sadness, recognition and rejection, respect and disrespect. But each phase has taught me valuable lessons which I have tried to imbibe.
